  "context": "Angel is a combination of a 2 meter high oak sculpture and a serpentine sculpture of approximately 30x15x15 cm. The sculpture stands on an octagonal platform made of dark stone.<br><br>The sculpture has two sides: on the front, the face of a woman. The limitations of the stone mean that the full form is not completely developed. The woman stands out because of her intricately shaped hair. She has a flower in her hair. The back of the sculpture is shaped in an organically abstract form.",
