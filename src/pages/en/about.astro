    Harry van de Ven, from Hengelo The Netherlands, started creating these sculptures relatively late in life. From an
    early age, he preferred working with wood. He received his first fretsaw when he was 8 years old, and soon, plywood
    and wood were being used for model building. At that time, wood was used for practical applications.

    In museums, he enjoyed art, and his love of history allowed him to place stylistic periods in the correct historical
    context. During his teacher training (Pabo), he was introduced to making abstract figures and the background of this
    form of art. While working in primary education, he again used wood, this time for creating educational materials.

    It wasnâ€™t until the age of 47 that he began creating the works displayed on this website.
